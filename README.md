# JS-promise-simulator
Application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose of this application is to demonstrate how promises work in JavaScript. A new promise is created that either
resolves or rejects based on a number generator function. If the function outputs a number >= 0.5, the function returns true and the promise resolves. Otherwise, the function
will return false and the promise will reject with an error. When the promise resolves, the application accesses mock data that renders a list of students names on the page.
When the promise rejects, the error messgae is rendered on the screen telling the user to reset the application and try again. A reset button allows the user to restart the
application.
